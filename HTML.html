<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The HTML process of coding was very interesting to me. I really enjoyed working on this portion of coding because it allowed me to place the foundations that could later be built upon. Unlike CSS, HTML focuses on aspects such as paragraphs, lists, headers, and other formatting occurences. Through HTML, you can add images, sound, text, and more. Then after using HTML is when you move onto aspects such as color and text size in CSS.</p>

<h2>Troubles with HTML</h2>
<p>One of the main issues I  faced, like with CSS, was organizing and familiarizing myself with the hundreds of elements in HTML. Because it is the main foundation for web design, there are so many details that are included in its code. For example, when working with text, not only are you dealing with positioning it as a headline, paragraph, title, etc. but then details such as italics and boldface are introduced. I do feel that HTML was more organized and more memorable because it was almost always the same main elements I used (such as parageraph, header, lists, body, etc.). Another struggle I had with HTML was dealing with the navigation bar and links to outside sources. The navigation bar confused me because I did not realize it had to be put on each seperate page of my website. In one of my first HTML asignments, I did not include it on all pages, so viewers had to return to the "Home Page" in order to see other sections of the site. Along the same lines, adding links to articles, images, youtube videos, etc. was difficult for me at first. When creating a website, all of our elements had to be placed in the same area on our computer so that the programmer knew where they were coming from. I had a hard time finding videos and images because some of the videos would say they were too large of attachments.  </p>

<h2>Successes with HTML</h2>
<p>Some of the major successes I had with HTML coding was in the formatting of my website. HTML taught me how to clearly and properly set up a page on my website so that it was not overcrowded or messy. I also appreciated that the HTML elements could be placed neatly ion my coding program so I could see where everything was and did not lose any specific part. I loved how it allowed to break up different sections and add onto it. I learned that although HTML may seem overehwleming or unimportant, it is the true basis for everything else in the coding system. </p>
