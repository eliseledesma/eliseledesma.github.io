   <h1>
    Why You Should Stop ‘Gamifying’ Your Health and Fitness
   </h1>
   <h4>You don't need to chase a fake goal to be able to chase a real goal.</h4>
   
   <p>By Beth Skwarecki</p>
   
   <img src="fitness.jpg" width="500" height="350">

<p>Real life doesn’t require fake metrics. You don’t need to rack up XP, because you’re gaining actual experience. You don’t need a fake quest, because you’re on a real quest. Whether that’s deadlifting 500 pounds or seeing better cholesterol numbers the next time you go to the doctor, your health habits have real-world rewards and consequences.</p>
<p>So let’s look at some of the ways gamification of health habits can backfire. Lifehacker staff writer Stephen Johnson explains the most common game tactics here, and that’s worth a read if you haven’t checked it out yet. Gamification is usually just manipulation, and it often has more downsides than benefits.</p>
<p>Instead of chasing game metrics, what if you put your attention on real life outcomes of your habits? Here’s what I mean.</p>
<h2>Aim for consistency, not streaks</h2>
<p>Streaks entertain you during good times with the explicit goal of heaping disappointment on you when you slip up. And they’re a particularly harmful type of misdirection, because people easily become more focused on the streak than on whatever reason they were doing the streak in the first place.</p>
<h3>Compete in real competitions, not fake competitions</h3>
<p>Some apps try to leverage the power of community by having you join a group of people you barely know, either to give each other emoji encouragement or to battle each other on a leaderboard (or both).</p>
<p>But...who cares about the people on that leaderboard? If they’re not well-matched, you won’t care about beating them. And if they’re not your real friends, you won’t care about their high-fives.</p>
<ul>
    <li> a local 5K, and trying to finish in the top X percent of your age group.</li>
    <li>Competing in something like a powerlifting meet, where you try to put up the best possible total on meet day.</li>
    <li>Joining a recreational sports league, and getting to know the members of your softball/soccer/pickleball team while either crushing the competition or commiserating about your inability to do so.
    </li>

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
