<h1>My Journey to Web Design!</h1>
</div>
<h2>
    About
</h2>
<div class="center">
<p> Welcome to my website! Over the past few months, I have had the privelage of learning different coding and web design programs through my MediaPro 303 class at Boise State University. Usually, my focus is on video and photography work on a camera or on a computer. It was not until this course that I was fully able to understand the basics of buidling a website that could potentially highlight these. Not only have I learned the basic foundations of HTML and CSS coding processes, but I also experimented with various outside sites such as Squarespace and Wordpress. Although these sites are pre-formatted, it was still a great skill to utilize for the future, or my future employer.
</p>

<div class="center">
<p> Before continuing to learn about my journey and how I progressed in web design, it is important to know the basic foundations about what the internet is and how it works. Linked below is a Youtube video shown to my class in the first week of school breaking down the key components of internet and how other elements build upon them! This video really helped me to get a visual of how the internet works and the programs installed into it, so give it a watch!</p>

<h2>
Basic Tools to Get You Started!
</h2>

<p>There were a few different tools I was able to use in the duration of the course to help guide me through my work. The first was <b>FreeCodeCamp</b>. This website offers super use4r-friendly step-by-step challenges to teach you different coding basics. I completed the "Legacy Responsive Web Design Certification", but they offer a variety of different certificates depending on what area of focus you want to learn about! </p>

</button>


<p>The second tool we used was W3 Schools. Once I had gotten a solid idea of how to code, I was able to reference <b>W3 Schools</b> to remember exactly how to format the coding I wanted. Because there is so much information involving coding, W3 is a great resource to refer back to on skills you have already learned. Along with this, it has exact coding examples and explains how to format them if you are needing extra help or want to try something new!</p>

   <h1>
    Why You Should Stop ‘Gamifying’ Your Health and Fitness
   </h1>
   <h4>You don't need to chase a fake goal to be able to chase a real goal.</h4>
   
   <p>By Beth Skwarecki</p>
   
   <img src="fitness.jpg" width="500" height="350">

<p>Real life doesn’t require fake metrics. You don’t need to rack up XP, because you’re gaining actual experience. You don’t need a fake quest, because you’re on a real quest. Whether that’s deadlifting 500 pounds or seeing better cholesterol numbers the next time you go to the doctor, your health habits have real-world rewards and consequences.</p>
<p>So let’s look at some of the ways gamification of health habits can backfire. Lifehacker staff writer Stephen Johnson explains the most common game tactics here, and that’s worth a read if you haven’t checked it out yet. Gamification is usually just manipulation, and it often has more downsides than benefits.</p>
<p>Instead of chasing game metrics, what if you put your attention on real life outcomes of your habits? Here’s what I mean.</p>
<h2>Aim for consistency, not streaks</h2>
<p>Streaks entertain you during good times with the explicit goal of heaping disappointment on you when you slip up. And they’re a particularly harmful type of misdirection, because people easily become more focused on the streak than on whatever reason they were doing the streak in the first place.</p>
<h3>Compete in real competitions, not fake competitions</h3>
<p>Some apps try to leverage the power of community by having you join a group of people you barely know, either to give each other emoji encouragement or to battle each other on a leaderboard (or both).</p>
<p>But...who cares about the people on that leaderboard? If they’re not well-matched, you won’t care about beating them. And if they’re not your real friends, you won’t care about their high-fives.</p>
<ul>
    <li> a local 5K, and trying to finish in the top X percent of your age group.</li>
    <li>Competing in something like a powerlifting meet, where you try to put up the best possible total on meet day.</li>
    <li>Joining a recreational sports league, and getting to know the members of your softball/soccer/pickleball team while either crushing the competition or commiserating about your inability to do so.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
