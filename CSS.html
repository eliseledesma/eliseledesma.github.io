<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Before this course, I had never worked with CSS coding before. CSS, otherwise known as Cascading Style Sheets, is the coding that allows you to change the way a webpage will look. In order to do CSS, you have to have HTML. CSS changes the way in which your website appears and is styled. I really enjoyed working with CSS coding. I saw it as a way to express my creativity and finally be able to utilize different colors, fonts, animations, etc. However, I was also extremely overwhelmed by the amount of elements that could be used in this coding. In my view, CSS highlighted smaller details such as sizing and exact placement which I found troublesome.While I was excited to be able to design how my webpage would look, I also found that I needed to pay more attention to how these elements would look together.</p>

<h2>Troubles with CSS</h2>
<p>Although I was able to build on my skills learned in the HTML portion of this course, I struggled with adding onto them. For one, there were so many color options to choose from, I had to balance and plan which colors went well with each other. Along with this, one of the tasks we were challeneged with was to utilize the animation feature of CSS. For several days, I found myself very frustrated because, even when my coding seemed perfect, the animation would not play out. However, after utilizing the "W3 Schools" website, I understood my mistakes and was able to finally get the animation to work! W3 Schools was a great tool I used for guidance and would recommend it to anyone who is new in coding and web design! I have linked it below if you are looking into starting your own web design journey! </p>

<h2>Successes with CSS</h2>
<p>Some of the major successes I had with CSS coding was in its organization. Through CSS coding, we used a "style" text file in order to divide up the seperate sections of our web pages and give them unique traits. For instance, in the "style" text file, I was able to change the different background colors, fonts, colors, size, and text alignment of my paragraphs, headers, etc. Having all of this coding udner one page made it much easier to go back and fix what I wanted to change or adjust what did not look visually pleasing. In CSS I was very successful at finding a style that is unique to me. I felt as if I had complete creative control over what images I used, along with the style elementts. This made me more inclined to make my website appealing and I had a super fun time using the CSS coding system! </p>
