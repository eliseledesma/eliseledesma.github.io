    <h2> How these Sites are Useful</h2>
<p>For those who are not familiar with coding with HTML and CSS, outside sites like WordPress, SqaureSpace, Wix, etc. allow people to still create their own websites with pre-formatted coding. These programs have templates that users can choose from and alter to fit their brand or business. They even have specific templates that are popularly used for certain areas of focus (ex. photography, blogging, shops, etc.). This way, those who want to have their own domain still can, without needing to know the ins and outs of CSS and HTML.</p>

<h2>WordPress</h2>
<p>The first outside site we used in this course was WordPress. I have always heard WordPress mentioned in different job applications, so I was excited to finally be giving it a try. Overall, I thought WordPress was a super user- friendly program. Although we were instructed to use a specific format provided by the site for our assignment, I did appreciate how many other options there were to choose from if I was to be using it on my own. Implementing my own elements and making the pages unique to myself, and stand out more compared to my peers, I felt WordPress made it very easy to add images, links, forms, etc. For example, my WordPress site was designed to showcase my photography work. In this, I had to insert my own pictures onto the page. WordPress offered unique ways to show these pictures. On my home page, I used a formatted slideshow element provided by the site so that viewers were not only visually engaged, but could also scroll through themselves. I also made a page called “Product Favorites & Most Used” where I was able to put in pictures of products I used, links to them, and text explaining what they are used for! The only main struggle I ran into when using this program was re-exporting my pictures into smaller sizes so that they did not show up blurry on the site. Other than this, I was very satisfied with the WordPress site and its convenience, especially to newcomers to coding and web design! I would definitely recommend WordPress to anyone who is new in their web design journey!

<h2>SquareSpace</h2>
<p>The second outside site we used in this course was SquareSpace. Similar to WordPress, SquareSpace offereed thousands of different formats to choose from, and because for this assignment we had creative control, I was able to choose one that I thought fit my brand correctly. However, when working with SqaureSpace, I had a much harder time. After having such a great experience with WordPress, I was excited to try out SquareSpace, as it is a program I hear about through ads and other media users. I foudn that unless you were following the exact way in which a page was formatted, it did not look visually appealing. For example, in the template I had chosen, there were certain elements I did not want to add in my version. However, if I took them out or deleted some of them, it would leave big gaps and awkward spacing between the elements I did not delete. Simple gestures such as adding text or images was more difficult, even though those were some of the easiest things to do in WordPress. I even had to use Youtube to look up how to add or delete certain things when in the program. Funny enough, in the end, I did like the way my SquareSpace page turned out more than my WordPress. I think this is because I was able to choose how I wanted it to look from the very beginning. </p>
